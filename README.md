## About 

This is the **Module 06 Challenge Project**. The point of this project was to add my new knowledge of Server-APIs and previous knowledge of Javascript, CSS, and HMTL to a project for which I was given no starter code. The finished product is a weather dashboard that displays weather information based off data entered by the user for a specific city.

## The Purpose 

The purpose of this application is to give users a five day weather forecast for any city they put into the search bar. It also gives the daily stats for temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

## Usage
 
 When the user first loads up this application, they will be prompted to "Search for a City:". Once they hit the search button, their city's information will be displayed on the page and their city name will be added to the ssearch history bar to be reclicked at any time.
